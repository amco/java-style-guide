# Android Data Binding Style Guide

[Data Binding Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) is aimed to decrease boilerplate code that doesnâ€™t require any brainpower (like findViewById calls, for example).

## Layouts

Data under <data> tag should be present in layout itself. In case data is pretty big, it is prefferable to move it out to separate file inside xml folder.

Reasonable case to use data binding is to set variable value to view property. However, there is a suggestion to avoid binding click events.
